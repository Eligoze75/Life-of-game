### Objective:
This is an example of a celular automaton from Conway's Game of life.  
We'll create board with cells, this cells have two possible status: live or dead. We are going to use a couple rules to determinate the changes of the status of each cell:

### Rules:
* Rule 1: Dead cell with 3 live neighbors, gets to live.
* Rule 2: Live cell with less than 2 or more than 3 live neighbors dies.

You can also affect the status by clicking on the board to "*give life*" to a cell.
